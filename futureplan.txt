Add $$ to database per user
Track user bets, wins, losses, amounts of bets and totals

vertically align navbar elements (im sure the image aligned them poorly)
make elements in navbar bigger as well
Icons under, or adjacent to, the links in the navbar

More drop down filters
More items per drop down as api allows
Dynamic? dropdowns maybe
Dropdowns that will exclude options in other dropdowns that do not apply
    (so each dropdown would be more specific, and choosing X in the prior will remove N/A options in Y, and so on)
placeholder for dropdown choice "Choose"
dropdown choice of "Any"
color dropdown box (light gray maybe)

Better all around page css layouts and designs

game/event dates searchable and in results

Input a Bet & see potential win & applicable fees/taxes
filter for range of values on spreads, payout odds, etc

user page that tracks/displays some number of bets either because they were bet on,
    have an interest to see it, or want to track it until the wager is favorable enough to take
